title: Crop Classification Using Satellite Imagery in the Orange River Valley, South Africa
---

The Orange River is a major agricultural region in South Africa that has been stricken by drought in recent years. Accurate data is needed to improve agricultural growth and manage for vulnerability in the face of global change. Sub-Saharan Africa in particular struggles with incomplete or unreliable data in the agricultural sector. In 2018, the international community organized to launch the 50 X 2030 initiative, a commitment to collect better farm data with the goal of ending hunger.

<p>The goal of this project is to build a model that can identify a crop with satellite imagery which can help with monitoring more quickly and cheaply. I chose to focus on identifying vineyards because wine from Orange River is South Africaâ€™s top exported agricultural product and is economically important to the region. 

<p> This project is a stepping stone to more advanced predictions such as crop yield prediction and predicted food security under future climate change scenarios.


## Data
Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo.


## Methods

Footnotes are supported as part of the Markdown syntax. Here's one in action. Clicking this number[^fn-sample_footnote] will lead you to a footnote. The syntax looks like:

{% highlight text %}
Clicking this number[^fn-sample_footnote]
{% endhighlight %}

Each footnote needs the `^fn-` prefix and a unique ID to be referenced for the footnoted content. The syntax for that list looks something like this:

{% highlight text %}
[^fn-sample_footnote]: Handy! Now click the return link to go back.
{% endhighlight %}

You can place the footnoted content wherever you like. Markdown parsers should properly place it at the bottom of the post.
