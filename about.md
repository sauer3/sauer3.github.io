---

I am a geospatial data scientist who has focused on climate change and biogeography for the past 10 years. I recently enrolled in Metis, a data science bootcamp and am exploring new tools and topics. My interests are diverse and recent projects include analyses of human rights, political polarization, and neighborhood change. 

Feel free to get in touch!
